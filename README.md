#  Tour-de-Michelin

## Overview
Using supervised learning model, we want to predict which New York restaurants are likely to become Michelin-star restaurants.

## Resources
Multiple datasets from Kaggle</br>
Software(s): Python 3.7, Scikit-Learn and Imbalanced-Learn libraries

## Purpose
We will employ different techniques to train and evaluate models. We plan to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.  We will oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm as well as using a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, we will compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to form our predictions on the likelihood of restaurants becoming Michelin-star rated.

### Week 1

* We created a branch for each section in the Rubric:  Presentation, Machine_Learning_Model, Database and Dashboard_Webpage.

* We tested scraping the Michelin website and decided to use datasets from Kaggle and OpenTable instead.

* We are researching the best place to store our databases.  Currently, the csv files are uploaded to the Database branch in this repository.
