#  Living in Nashville

## Overview
We want to predict why people live in certain areas of Nashville.  Since there is no known output, we will use unsupervised learning and share our findings with data visualizations.  We started with a housing dataset, then investigated school enrollment and rankings, and social features such as parks and restaurants.  We will combine the datasets and investigate to determine common denominators that drive decisions on where to live in/around Nashville.

## Week 1

* We created a branch for each section in the Rubric:  Presentation, Machine_Learning_Model, Database and Dashboard_Webpage.

* We found several datasets as noted above and began testing to determine the features we would use.

* We each took a dataset to work with as part of our joined dataset and they are uploaded to the Database branch.
