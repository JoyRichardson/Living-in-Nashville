#  Living in Nashville

## Overview
The fastest growing city in Tennessee is the Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Franklin metro area. Its population grew by 19.1% from 2010 to 2020 to 1,961,232 residents. During that same time, the population of Tennessee grew by 8.5%, and the U.S. population increased by 6.7%. 

With the COVID-19 pandemic a bit under control, the U.S. economy has made an incredible comeback. Consumer spending is strong, jobs are coming back, and the housing market is booming, and quite possibly the hottest it’s been in years.

Here locally in Middle Tennessee, there’s a new spotlight on our economic growth. Through several economic downturns, a massive flood, and tornadoes, Nashville has always shown resilience. Now is no different.

Our team lives in and around the Nashville area so as our final project, we chose to predict the sales price of housing in the Nashville Metro area based on key factors that may have influence on the price of the houses.

## Week 1

* Created a branch for each section in the Rubric:  Presentation, Machine_Learning_Model, Database and Dashboard_Webpage.

* Found several datasets as noted above. Each dataset needed manual editing in preparation to include zip codes as our common feature.

* Final determination was made to use pgAdmin for our server and AWS for our database.

## Week 2

* Reviewed each dataset to determine the columns to drop and began Extract, transform, load (ETL) process on the data

* Created pg Admin server and AWS database and all team members connected

* Final determination was made to use Supervised Learning with the Regression model to minimize the error of prediction.  The target will be the Sales Price.

* Began creation of Machine Learning Model

* Began learning/working with Google slides
